# WordCloudByAlim
A lightweight Python tool for efficient data scaling using the waffle algorithm. Optimize performance in ML models and data analysis tasks.
This code generates word clouds based on input text data. It utilizes the `wordcloud` library to create visually appealing word cloud visualizations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/alimul-khan/WordCloudByAlim.git


2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Prepare the input text files:
- Ensure you have two text files: `cv.txt` and `job.txt`.
- Update the content of `cv.txt` with your CV or any other text you want to generate a word cloud for.
- Update the content of `job.txt` with the job description or any other text you want to generate a word cloud for.

4. Run the script:
python wordcloud_generator.py

5. The generated word clouds will be saved as `CV_WordCloud.png` and `Job_WordCloud.png` in the current directory.
